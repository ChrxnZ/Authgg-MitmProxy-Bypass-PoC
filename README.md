# auth.gg Bypass
### About the Project
This Bypass allows you to spoof the HTTP-POST request JSON response of api.auth.gg to allow immediate access.
There will be 2 versions of files, the bypass (Bypass.py), and another file which allows you to further on spoof the HTTP-POST request JSON response (Spoof.py).
### Background Information
This bypass was originally made over 3 months ago (which could make this the first official actual working bypass). The bypass was made alongside multiple people, consisting of Me (ChrxnZ/Pulsed#1874), [YeetDisDude](https://github.com/YeetDisDude) & [TonicBoomerKewl](https://github.com/TonicBoomerKewl).
### More Information
This project was made to be as small as possible for efficiency, in which we got it to work on a 2GB Ram + Intel Celeron Laptop, which could also perhaps make it the smallest auth.gg Bypass.
